# N8N Webhook Response Configuration

Based on your successful webhook test, here's how to configure your N8N Response node:

## Your N8N Response Node Should Return:

```json
{
  "projectId": "{{$json.body.projectId}}",
  "status": "received", 
  "message": "Project generation started successfully"
}
```

## Current Working Configuration:

✅ **Webhook URL**: `https://smart-nocode.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/prd-generator`
✅ **Method**: POST
✅ **Data Reception**: Working perfectly - your webhook is receiving all data correctly

## Data Structure Being Received:

Your webhook is successfully receiving:
- `projectId`: ✅ 
- `userId`: ✅
- `projectName`: ✅
- `description`: ✅
- `techStack`: ✅
- `targetPlatform`: ✅
- `complexity`: ✅
- `projectSpec`: ✅ (with all sub-fields)
- `timestamp`: ✅
- `requestId`: ✅

## Next Steps:

1. **Set up your Response node** in N8N to return the expected format above
2. **Test the form submission** - database issue should now be fixed
3. **Switch to production mode** when ready to use real webhooks

Your webhook integration is working perfectly! The only issue was the database user constraint.
